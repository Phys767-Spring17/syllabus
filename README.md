# Syllabus for Phys 767 (Spring 2017)

## Meeting times and location
- Feb 1–May 17, 2017
- Wednesdays 10am–1:45 pm 
- Simons Center for Computational Astrophysics, 162 Fifth Avenue

## Instructor
 Prof. Kelle Cruz 
 kellecruz@gmail.com 

## Course Description
This project-based course focuses on tools, best practices, and workflows common in Astrophysics research. These include 
topics in Python programming, statistics, and data vizualization. 

## Requirements
- **Laptop**: A laptop, perferably a Mac, is required for in class work.
  - Python 3 is the non-optional programming language for the course.
- **GitHub account**: all assignments will be submitted and graded via [GitHub](http://github.com).
- **Slack account**: communication between the professor and other students will use dedicated [Slack](https://phys767.slack.com/shared_invite/MTM1MDU1ODg4Mzg3LTE0ODU4OTkzMDgtYTgwMDk4NjUxNA) channel

## Recommended Textbooks
- **[Practical Statistics for Astronomers](http://amzn.to/2jgYAyI)**
  - http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/jvw/ASTROSTATS/
- **[Effective Computation in Physics: Field Guide to Research with Python](http://amzn.to/2kvedaZ)**
  - http://physics.codes/
- **[The Art of Readable Code](http://amzn.to/2j6LMQp)**
- **[Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design](http://amzn.to/2klNb2z)**

## Discussion Forums
- Use [Slack](https://phys767.slack.com/shared_invite/MTM1MDU1ODg4Mzg3LTE0ODU4OTkzMDgtYTgwMDk4NjUxNA) for realtime chat and to provide Professor with updates
- [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phys767-spring2017) will be used sparingly for course announcements.

## Assignments
Course assignments will be individualized based on the background, experience, and interests of each student. They will be discussed at the beginning and end of each class meeting and clear milestones will be agreed upon between the student and the Professor. It is anticipated that each student will contribute to 2--3 distinct projects throughout the span of the semester.

## Grading
Grades will be based on in-class participation, contributions to team projects, and demonstrated **progress** in three main areas:

1. programming best practices
2. statistics proficiency
3. data vizualization

Students who are not on track for getting an 'A' will be contacted privately by the instructor. 

## Programming Topics
The first third of the semester focuses on a mastery of Github. The second third emphasizes commenting, documentation, and code review. Finally, unit testing will be introduced.
